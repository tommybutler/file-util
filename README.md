=========

This is the git repository for the File::Util Perl 5 package

If you want to DOWNLOAD a packaged release of File::Util, this is not the 
place to get it. Use your CPAN client or download a package from 
http://search.cpan.org (search for File::Util)

If you want HELP with File::Util, or even if you want to complain about 
it, send me an email from www.atrixnet.com/contact or post your question 
at www.perlmonks.org

If you want INFORMATION about File::Util, go to http://search.cpan.org/~tommy 
and click on the "File::Util" link. All the documentation and packaged 
distributions are there.

To report a BUG, go here:
   https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Name=File%3A%3AUtil

If you want to CONTRIBUTE to File::Util, clone it, patch it, and generally 
feel invited to participate in whatever way you may wish via the git 
mechanism (git://github.com/tommybutler/file-util.git)

This project was a private endeavor for too long so don't hesitate to pitch in. 
I want to say I very much appreciate the bug reports, patches, and testers.
