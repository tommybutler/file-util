TODO List for File::Util

Not necessarily listed in order of priority:

1)  [DONE] Set up formal (not just private) GIT repository

2)  Separate documenation examples into a cookbook (POD)

3)  Gradually transform methods to accept input parameters in a
    *::Class-like style (hashrefs, etc) while preserving backward
    compatibility

4)  Support for Perl IO "layers", which just hasn't been requested but
    should be there for completeness

5)  Transform (where useful) various methods to accept callbacks.
    File::Util::list_dir() is the primary target

6)  Set up File::Util::list_dir() to take a listref of regexes

7)  [IN PROGRESS] Continue improving the distribution so as to make
    it compliant with Fedora packaging standards; it is already a
    maintained package for Ubuntu and ActiveState

8)  [DONE] Code clean up in POD documentation examples.

9)  Improve and simplify code examples in POD documentation.

10) [IN PROGRESS] Constantly improve test suite until Devel::Cover
    scores are something to be proud of.
