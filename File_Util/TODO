TODO List for File::Util

1) [DONE] Set up formal (not just private) GIT repository

2) Separate documenation examples into a cookbook (POD)

3) Gradually transform methods to accept input parameters in a
   *::Class-like style (hashrefs, etc) while preserving backward
   compatibility

4) Support for Perl IO "layers", which just hasn't been requested but
   should be there for completeness

5) Transform (where useful) various methods to accept callbacks.
   File::Util::list_dir() is the primary target

6) Set up File::Util::list_dir() to take a listref of regexes

7) Continue improving the distribution so as to make it compliant
   with Fedora packaging standards; it is already an Ubuntu package
