NEWS for File::Util

Mon Dec 31 23:25:00 CST 2012
   This latest release (v 3.33) is not a feature release.  It's a
   documentation update, a few bug fixes, several code optimizations, and
   code cleanup.  Mostly, it is a great step forward in the CPAN package
   itself.  Read on for more details...

   Please have a look at the CHANGES file, because there have been and will
   continue to be big changes/improvements to File::Util both in terms of the
   code itself and the CPAN distribution package releases.

   File::Util is now migrated to git and uses Dist::Zilla to create a
   build environment that works better in windows platforms.  This
   brought about the moving the content of Util.pod back into Util.pm
   which does have its benefits, but makes the actual file size larger
   than I want; I'll probably soon make a cookbook and slim down the main
   documentation a bit, since it's very exhaustive, and bring things back
   into the file sizes I like to see.  Compile times and run times have
   not been affected by the POD move.

   File::Util now must pass Perl::Critic tests as well, therefore the
   so-called CPANTS "kwalitee" of the code has been markedly increased.

   File::Util will be signed with a Module::Signature from now on, as
   long as this doesn't introduce failures in the build/test phases for
   CPAN testers and end users alike.

   These changes are part of an overall effort to "keep moving forward",
   make things better, and also make the distribution compliant with
   Fedora and Debian packaging standards.  File::Util already has a
   maintained package for Ubuntu.

   There's a writeup of my most recent reflections on File::Util that I
   posted on Perl Monks which explains some of my new goals for the
   distribution, the code, and the future of File::Util.  You can read it at

   Happy new year!
