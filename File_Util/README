File::Util
=========================

DESCRIPTION
File::Util provides a comprehensive toolbox of utilities to automate all
kinds of common tasks on file / directories.  Its purpose is to do so
in the most portable manner possible so that users of this module won't
have to worry about whether their programs will work on other OSes
and machines.


CHANGES IN LAST FEW RELEASES
(listed in reverse chronological order by date and subversion)

   2.27
      Sat Dec  6 13:10:00 CST 2008
      Fixed a bug that caused root directories using Micro$oft filesystem
      notation to be mis-read when using the '--dirs-only' flag for
      File::Util::list_dir()

   3.26
      Tue Dec  2 20:07:09 CST 2008
      Added to test suite in order to avoid errant test failures
      when flock'ing on solaris.  This is a big deal, since the point of
      File::Util is to be easy, and portable!

      Added some yet more extra examples in the documentation.

   3.25
      Mon Dec 1 15:11:20 CST 2008
      Fixed a bug in File::Util::touch()

      Added some extra examples and corrected one minor error in the
      documentation.

   3.24
      Wed May 23 16:27:20 CDT 2007
      **Don't use this version.  It has a bug.  Use 3.25 or greater.

      Added method File::Util::last_changed (get inode change time for a file)
      Added method File::Util::touch (works like *nix touch command)

      Both touch and last_changed are autoloaded methods

      Applied patch from S. Muskiewicz that fixes the File::Util::last_modified
      method that was using a similar but incorrect "-" file test operator.
