File::Util
=========================

DESCRIPTION
File::Util provides a comprehensive toolbox of utilities to automate all
kinds of common tasks on file / directories.  Its purpose is to do so
in the most portable manner possible so that users of this module won't
have to worry about whether their programs will work on other OSes
and machines.


CHANGES IN LAST FEW RELEASES
(listed in reverse chronological order, excluding development releases)

   3.31
      Tue Nov 20 16:33:10 CST 2012
      Adds new method: File::Util::atomize() which explodes a fully-qualified
      filename into it's root, path, and filename... which was necessary
      to squish the long-standing bug in fully-qualified file names on
      MS Windows... Also, the '--rpattern=^pat$' flag should works recursively
      for you in File::Util::list_dir(), in order to provide you with patterns
      that are applied at every level in your file tree, while preserving the
      current behavior of the '--pattern=^pat$' flag, which is not applied
      recursively.  Another bug bites the dust.

      Fixes CPAN RT# 46368 and 64775, respectively

      Lots of code cleanup, and more documentation forthcoming in next release
      will be here very soon, primarily to document the small additions here
      and also to clean up the documentation itslef (particularly the code
      examples which need style-fixes).  This is a stable release.

   3.30_003
      Thu, Nov 15, 2012  5:59:38 PM
      Development release.  BETA.  Do not use for production!  This release
      introduces new code optimizations and extensive cleanup.  The previously
      required module Class::OOorNO has been removed from the prerequisites
      and any methods that it exported are no longer available for import to
      your namespace(s).  This shouldn't be a problem though, because that
      module was almost never used at all, and no one ever even knew you
      could get its methods from File::Util anyway.  Onward and upward, we're
      inching slowly but surely toward 3.30 final.

   3.30_001
      Mon Nov 12 18:00:16 CST 2012
      Development release.  BETA.  Do not use for production!  This release
      attempts to fix MS Windows-related problems, and introduces bugfixes
      for CPAN RT# 46368 and 67399.  As a result, the test suite has been
      slightly improved (and will continue to improve).

      There's been a lot of code refactoring and regex optimization.  A lot
      of planning and work will be going into 3.30, and this is the first
      release candidate.

   2.29
      Wed Oct 17 09:38:36 CDT 2012
      Fixed bug where list_dir() did not continue to recurse if it encountered
      an error while running with the --fatals-as-warning flag.  If running
      in default mode, it is normal behavior for File::Util to abort execution
      on error, but when running with --fatals-as-warning flag, such errors
      should not have caused recursion to fail.  (CPAN RT# 52319)

      Changed the brackets surrounding error messages to "<<" and ">>" so that
      the glyphs display in most terminals.

      Modified/updated documentation and test suite to accomodate these new
      changes.

   2.28
      Sat Sep 29 17:38:47 CDT 2012
      Adding a patch to fix breakage under Perl 5.17 (CPAN RT#31013)

      Fix spelling error in documentation and code comments (CPAN RT# #64854)
